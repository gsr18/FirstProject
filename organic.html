            <h2>What is Organic Farming?</h2>
            <p>
                Organic farming is a method of farming that relies on natural processes and avoids the use of synthetic chemicals,
                pesticides, and fertilizers. It nurtures soil health through crop rotation, composting, and other regenerative practices.
                By focusing on a balanced ecosystem, organic farming promotes biodiversity and ensures food that is free from harmful residues.
            </p>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Benefits of Organic Farming</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Environmental Protection:</strong> Organic farming reduces pollution, conserves water, reduces soil erosion, and increases soil fertility.</li>
                <li><strong>Better Soil Health:</strong> Techniques like crop rotation and composting promote nutrient-rich and resilient soil.</li>
                <li><strong>Healthier Produce:</strong> Organic farming results in crops that are free from synthetic pesticides, providing healthier food for consumers.</li>
                <li><strong>Promotes Biodiversity:</strong> Organic farms support a wider range of plants, animals, and insects, which help to balance the ecosystem.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Turning Ignored Services into Opportunities</h2>
            <p>
                Organic farming offers a unique opportunity to turn traditionally ignored agricultural practices into thriving business models.
                With increasing consumer demand for organic, sustainably sourced products, farmers and entrepreneurs alike can capitalize on this trend.
                By providing pure and natural produce, you're not just farmingâ€”you're cultivating trust, health, and sustainability.
            </p>
            <p>
                Adopting organic farming practices and selling direct from farm to table opens a pathway to a stable and growing market.
                As consumers seek quality and transparency, organic farming has the power to transform agriculture, create jobs,
                and establish a stronger relationship with local communities. This overlooked service has the potential to yield profitable returns,
                while creating positive environmental and social impacts.
